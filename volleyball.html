Each team tries to score points by grounding a ball on the other team's court under organized rules. It has been a part of the official program of the Summer Olympic Games since Tokyo 1964.
          </p>                      
          <p>
            The complete set of rules are extensive,but play essentially proceeds as follows: a player on one of the teams begins a 'rally' by serving the ball (tossing or releasing it and then hitting it with a hand or arm), from behind the back boundary line of the court, over the net, and into the receiving team's court. The receiving team must not let the ball be grounded within their court. The team may touch the ball up to 3 times, but individual players may not touch the ball twice consecutively. Typically, the first two touches are used to set up for an attack, an attempt to direct the ball back over the net in such a way that the serving team is unable to prevent it from being grounded in their court.
          </p>              
          <p>
            The rally continues, with each team allowed as many as three consecutive touches, until either (1): a team makes a kill, grounding the ball on the opponent's court and winning the rally; or (2): a team commits a fault and loses the rally. The team that wins the rally is awarded a point and serves the ball to start the next rally.
          </p>            
          <p>
            The ball is usually played with the hands or arms, but players can legally strike or push (short contact) the ball with any part of the body.<br> A number of consistent techniques have evolved in volleyball, including spiking and blocking (because these plays are made above the top of the net, the vertical jump is an athletic skill emphasized in the sport) as well as passing, setting, and specialized player positions and offensive and defensive structures.

            <img class="flowRight" src="https://cdn.glitch.com/89de452c-73f2-4f86-a0a4-616e693495b5%2Fvolleyball-section2.jpg?v=1581538768473" alt="VolleyballImage2" width="350" height="230">In the winter of 1895, in Holyoke, Massachusetts (United States), William G. Morgan, a YMCA physical education director, created a new game called Mintonette, a name derived from the game of badminton, as a pastime to be played (preferably) indoors and by any number of players. The game took some of its characteristics from other sports such as tennis and handball. Another indoor sport, basketball, was catching on in the area, having been invented just ten miles (sixteen kilometres) away in the city of Springfield, Massachusetts, only four years before. Mintonette was designed to be an indoor sport, less rough than basketball, for older members of the YMCA, while still requiring a bit of athletic effort.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first rules, written down by William G Morgan, called for a net 6 ft 6 in (1.98 m) high, a 25 ft × 50 ft (7.6 m × 15.2 m) court, and any number of players. A match was composed of nine innings with three serves for each team in each inning, and no limit to the number of ball contacts for each team before sending the ball to the opponents' court. In case of a serving error, a second try was allowed. Hitting the ball into the net was considered a foul (with loss of the point or a side-out)—except in the case of the first-try serve.
          </p>
          <p>
            After an observer, Alfred Halstead, noticed the volleying nature of the game at its first exhibition match in 1896, played at the International YMCA Training School (now called Springfield College), the game quickly became known as volleyball (it was originally spelled as two words: "volley ball"). Volleyball rules were slightly modified by the International YMCA Training School and the game spread around the country to various YMCAs.

                    Brazil never won its initial Olympic medal which was silver until 1984. That is two years following its initial World Championship medal which was also silver. From that time, Brazilians have been ruling. They possess 10 Olympic indoor medals which is the second position to the former Soviet Union and nine World Championship indoor medals just behind Soviet Union/Russia. The country also won the world-best 17 World Grand Prix and 18 FIVB World League medals.

                    Brazil even dominates more on the beach. Overall, it has won thirteen Olympic medals, and by far it has the most medals in World Championship which is 15 over the second-place nation. Besides, it owns many records to be counted on the FIVB World Tour. The hosting country secured three out of four disciplines in Rio. That is; men indoor gold, mean beach gold and women beach silver. However, amazingly to some people, the haul was a letdown

                    There has also been the key American squabble for volleyball supremacy due to the reason that: the country has acquired six beach gold awards within six Olympics as compared to three that Brazil won. However, after that, there is nothing big to say about the U.S. volleyball program.

                    Indoors, the women in the U.S. were leading in the global rankings at Rio where they left with bronze. They have not won an Olympic gold medal before apart from two bronzes and three silvers. The indoor men in the U.S. have three Olympic golds, tied for the initial time with the Soviet Union and Brazil. The men within the U.S. likewise have two bronze medals, making their entire Olympic medal as position three. Americans have been able to win only Bronze in Rio with the indoor men and women coming; third, as did April Ross and Kerri Walsh Jennings on the beach.

                    Solely, China earns its place on this catalog from the power of women. Chinese men have yet to win a medal at a major global competition. So far, the country’s women have obtained five world indoor medals, six Olympic indoor awards, four beach world medals, and two beach volleyball Olympic medals. Those numbers place them in position five for every competition. The indoor women obtained their Rio their third Olympic gold; the tally that trails just the Soviet Union.

                    Russia has incurred small effect in beach volleyball which is merely one World Championship medal although the men’s pair turned out as position four in Rio but as for some time been a force indoors. The counts of medals are skewed since Russia gets credit for several medals taken by the previous Soviet Union. However, Russia was part of the big USSR.

                    Before it was dissolved, the Soviet Union won 12 Olympic volleyball medals which is the leading overall. Russia has six particular medals in the previous six games. However, the best position of Russia in Rio was fourth by men’s indoor group. That is after U.S. won with the bronze-medal and became fourth position for the beach duo of Konstantin Semenov and Viacheslav Krasilnikov.

                    Germany takes the fifth position due to its rising on the beach. German men acquired the 2012 Olympic beach volleyball gold while women topped the Rio podium. In both moments, the German duos defeated Brazilians in the final Olympics. More so, Germans have acquired five beach World Championship medals trailing behind U.S. and Brazil in the entire count.

                    Indoors, just East Germany gathered Olympic medals. That is men’s silver in 1972, and women’s silver in 1980. However, the East German/German men acquired two World Championship medals; most recently is the 2014 bronze while women gathered two World Grand Prix medals. Neither the indoor women or men qualified for Rio.
