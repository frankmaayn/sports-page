          <h2>2020 NBA All-Star Game</h2>

            The 2020 NBA All-Star Game was an exhibition game played on February 16, 2020. It was the 69th edition of the event. The game was held at the United Center in Chicago, Illinois, home of the Chicago Bulls. This was the third time that Chicago hosted the All-Star Game. The other two times, in 1973 and 1988, the game was played at Chicago Stadium, the Bulls' previous home arena. The game was televised nationally by TNT for the 18th consecutive year.
          </p>
          <h3>Coaches</h3>
          <p>
            The two coaches came from the two teams leading their respective conferences as of February 2, 2020, with certain restrictions. Frank Vogel, coach of the Western Conference leading Los Angeles Lakers, qualified as the head coach for Team LeBron on January 23. Nick Nurse, coach of the Toronto Raptors, qualified as the head coach for Team Giannis on January 31. Although the Milwaukee Bucks clinched the best record in the Eastern Conference, their coach, Mike Budenholzer, was ineligible to coach in the All-Star Game as league rules prohibited a coach from coaching in consecutive All-Star Games (he had coached in the 2019 game).
          </p>
          <h3>Rosters</h3>
          <p>
            <img src="https://cdn.glitch.com/89de452c-73f2-4f86-a0a4-616e693495b5%2Fbasketball-image2.jpg?v=1582571357716" class="flowLeft" alt="basketball-image" width="400" height="300">As had been the case in previous years, the rosters for the All-Star Game were selected through a voting process. The fans could vote through the NBA website as well as through their Google account. The starters were chosen by the fans, media, and current NBA players. Fans made up 50% of the vote, and NBA players and media each comprised 25% of the vote. The two guards and three frontcourt players who received the highest cumulative vote totals in each conferences were named the All-Star starters and two players in each conferences with the highest votes were named team captains.NBA head coaches voted for the reserves for their respective conferences, none of which could be players from their own team. Each coach selected two guards, three frontcourt players and two wild cards, with each selected player ranked in order of preference within each category. If a multi-position player was to be selected, coaches were encouraged to vote for the player at the position that was "most advantageous for the All-Star team", regardless of where the player was listed on the All-Star ballot or the position he was listed in box scores.</p>
          <p>
            The All-Star Game starters were announced on January 23, 2020. Trae Young of the Atlanta Hawks and Kemba Walker of the Boston Celtics were named the backcourt starters in the East, earning their first and fourth all-star appearances, respectively.
